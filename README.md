# Hacking with Swift

This a repository to accompany Hacking with Swift, [a free tutorial series that teaches Swift coding for iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com).

All projects are compatible with Xcode 10 and iOS 12. 

Each project has it's own folder so files keep organise and clean.

## Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/Icicleta/hackingwithswift/tree/master/Project_01)

  Produce an application that lets users scroll through a list of images, then select one to view.
 
- [Project 2](https://github.com/Icicleta/hackingwithswift/tree/master/Project_02)

  Make a game using UIKit, and learn about integers, buttons, colors and actions.
